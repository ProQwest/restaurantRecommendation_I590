# restaurantRecommendation_I590
A recommendation system is an application that can identify entities of interest for a person and provide suggestions based on the past record of personâ€™s likes and preferences. The entity of interest can be anything, for example it can be a product, a movie or a news article. As a part of this project, we are planning to build a recommendation system which can suggest restaurants that might be of interest to a Yelp user. To achieve this, we are utilizing the academic Yelp dataset which has about 1.6M reviews by 366K users.
